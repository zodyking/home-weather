1: 7 day forecast has to be first tab not 24 hour forecast

2: I dont want visible scroll bars on forecast section use hiden scroll bars

3: lets use anew set of aniamted weather icons https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons its more full library with night and day  stuff plus more...

4: 24 hour card data need to me arrange in this manor
    -Time (done)
    -Icon (done)
    -Condition (done)
    -two Columns Line1: Hi Temp "Hi: #" Right Coulum line 1: Low Temp "Low: #"
    comlumn line 2 : Wind "Wind: #mph"  line 2 right column: Percipatation "Precip: %"

5: Follow same layout for 7 day forecast card

6: the grid component we use for Temperature Precipitation Wind looks soo bad find another web component for a grid and rather lets combine all info into one grid with a seprate line for Temperature (Red), Precipitation (Blue), Wind (gray) i want the grid to have point on the line user can click or drag to see value at each hour segment, a more stylish and functional grid layout :)

7: Reformat the header in a more stylish and card filling way
